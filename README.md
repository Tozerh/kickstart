#**Analysis for Louise on Kickstarter Campaign Data**
##A brief analysis of Kickstarter campaign data to assist in a possible theatrical production.

##**Charts**
---
Good news: Kickstarter is friendly to theatrical productions! 
---
The chart below breaks down campaign statuses by main category:
---
---
![Graph of KS Statuses by Category]("C:\Users\TTHammond\Desktop\git\KSData\MonthOutcomes")
---
The data bears out that theater campaigns are widely accepted and supported on Kickstarter, with a total of 912 campaigns in the theater category in the US. 525 of these US-based campaigns were successful,  success rate of 58%. 
---
---
Breaking this graph down further, we can isolate for the subcategory "plays" and see the following: 
---
![Graph of KS Stasuses by Subcategory "Plays"]("C:\Users\TTHammond\Desktop\git\KSData\SubcategoryOutcomes")
---
Of the 912 US-based theater campaigns, 671 (74%) of these were plays, with 412 (61%) of these plays finding successful funding on KickStarter. The success rate for the "play" subcategory in the data is slightly higher than the 58% success rate above for all US-based theater campaign categories.

The final chart below displays **when** you might be more successful launching your campaign: 
---
![Launch Date Outcomes by Month]("C:\Users\TTHammond\Desktop\git\KSData\MonthOutcomes")
---
Theater campaigns (both in the US and internationally) see a sharp rise in successful funding between March and May, reaching a peak in May, and then falling off steadily between May and September.

##**Recommendations**
I would recommend the following strategy for a US-based Kickstarter theater campaign. I think that you're right to focus on a play, given their success rate, and you will want to be sure that you are ready to launch the campaign no later than early April to ride the early-Spring momentum for campaigns like yours. Given the work you've already put into thinking through this, I believe you're in a great position to take advantage of the Kickstarter platform.

In terms of your funding goal, the data cautions us to not set too loft a goal. The $10,000 goal that you have set is about double the average funding goal for successful theater campaigns ($5,000). It may make more sense to adjust the scope of the production in order to lower your budget or maybe you can split the production into two parts to target a smaller funding goal with each. Of note, the average for failed campaigns is right at $10,000, and I want to see your project succeed!
